# Discord.js User

## What Do We Do

We create packages and resources to help you access Discord as a User using JavaScript, so you could make your own discord app, make a self bot, or edit the current discord app.

## Why Do We Do It

We do this mostly as a passion project, but we also do it because we feel there are many possibilities with resources like these.
