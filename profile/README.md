# Discord.js User

## Installation

Run this script in your shell to install the `Discord.js User` (`djs-user`) Package.

```sh
npm i djs-user
```

## What Do We Do

We create packages and resources to help you access Discord as a User using JavaScript, so you could edit the discord app, make a user bot, or even make your own discord app!

## Why Do We Do It

We do this mostly as a passion project, but we also do it because we feel there are many possibilities with resources like these.
